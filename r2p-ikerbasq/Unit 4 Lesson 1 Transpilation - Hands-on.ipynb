    "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. These are problems where the goal is to find the optimal solution from a set of finite possible outcomes that are often encountered in tasks like routing, scheduling, or resource allocation. QAOA operates by applying quantum operations that approximate the optimal solution, making it a promising approach for potentially solving these problems efficiently on near-term quantum computers.\n",

    "⚠️ **Note:** The concept of optimization enters in two distinct ways in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Solving the Classical Optimization Problem:** Our primary goal is to solve a classical optimization problem by encoding it into quantum circuits and running an algorithm to find a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimizing Circuit Performance:** There are multiple ways to implement a quantum circuit, each yielding the same result but varying in efficiency on real hardware. Here, we focus on optimizing the circuit implementation to improve its performance characteristics on quantum devices\n",

    "QAOA works by encoding the problem into a quantum circuit that evolves through a series of unitary operations. The algorithm iteratively adjusts these operations to find the optimal solution. The two main components of QAOA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Function Hamiltonian (HC):** This is the problem-specific part of the circuit that encodes the objective function of the optimization problem. The goal of the QAOA is to find the parameters that minimize the expectation value of the cost function, driving the quantum system towards the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mixer Hamiltonian (HM):** This component of the circuit drives the exploration of the solution space. It typically uses single-qubit rotations that evolve the quantum state away from an initial, easily-prepared state.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will focus on optimizing the **cost function circuit** of QAOA. The cost function circuit is crucial because it directly relates to the problem you want to solve.

    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, a quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits to perform a computation. However, the circuit you initially design isn't always optimal for execution on a real quantum computer. This is where **transpilation** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpilation Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`init`:** This stage involves preparing the circuit by converting any custom instructions into single- and two-qubit gates, which are standard types of gates that the QPU can execute. This step also validates the circuit's instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`layout`:** During this stage, the virtual qubits in your circuit are mapped to the physical qubits on the QPU. This mapping is crucial because it determines how the qubits interact with each other based on the device's connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`routing`:** After applying the layout, the circuit may need additional gates (such as SWAP gates) to ensure that qubits can interact according to the device's coupling map. This stage injects these gates to maintain the circuit's logical structure while adhering to the hardware's connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`translation`:** In this stage, the circuit's gates are translated into the specific set of instructions (basis gates) that the QPU can execute. This ensures that the circuit is compatible with the device's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`optimization`:** This stage involves applying various optimization passes to reduce the circuit's depth and gate count. The goal is to find more efficient ways to represent the circuit that minimize the potential for errors and noise during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`scheduling`:** The final stage is scheduling, which organizes the execution of the circuit's instructions to account for idle times and other hardware constraints. This stage is particularly important for optimizing circuits on near-term devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the specifics of each of these stages, **check out this documentation link on [IBM Quantum Documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/transpiler-stages).**\n",

    "Qiskit provides a convenient way to perform transpilation through **preset pass managers** using [`generate_preset_pass_manager`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/defaults-and-configuration-options). These are predefined sets of transpilation passes that optimize the circuit to varying degrees depending on the selected **optimization level**:\n",

    "- **Level 0:** *[No Optimization]* - Basic translation with trivial qubit mapping and no optimizations, primarily for hardware characterization.\n",

    "\n",
    "When working with quantum circuits, the process of transpilation involves many **stochastic passes, which means the results can vary each time you transpile the same circuit**. In practice, running the transpiler multiple times may lead to better results in terms of circuit depth, gate count, and overall optimization. This is because some of the randomization involved in the transpilation process might occasionally yield a more efficient circuit layout or routing. One effective method to achieve more predictable outcomes is to use the `seed_transpiler` option. By varying a seed, you can control the randomization of the transpilation process, making it easier to reproduce and compare results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the process multiple times and keep the best outcome based on your chosen metric (e.g., minimal gate count, execution time). This can be achieved by running a loop over several transpilation attempts, each with a fixed seed, and selecting the most optimized circuit.\n",

    "### Applying Transpilation Strategies Using Custom and Staged Pass Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll learn how to integrate these optimization strategies into your custom pass manager to improve your quantum circuit. In Qiskit SDK, Custom `PassManagers` allow fine-grained control over the transpilation process by enabling users to define a specific sequence of optimization and transformation passes. These passes can target specific goals such as reducing circuit depth, improving fidelity, or adapting to the hardware topology.  By applying a combination of these methods, you can see how each strategy contributes to the overall circuit efficiency, making it more suitable for execution on IBM Quantum backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StagedPassManager` organizes the transpilation workflow into distinct stages, each stage being a `PassManager` focusing on different optimization goals, such as initial layout selection, gate reduction, or final qubit mapping. This staged approach allows for incremental improvements and conditional passes that apply only when necessary, offering a structured way to fine-tune the balance between execution speed and circuit fidelity. Together, the custom `PassManager` and `StagedPassManager` enable deeper exploration of transpilation strategies, giving developers full control over the optimization process to create circuits best suited for specific hardware constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Pass Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a **`PassManager`** allows you to apply a sequence of optimization passes to a quantum circuit, transforming it for more efficient execution on quantum hardware. By creating a custom pass manager, you can tailor the optimization to your circuit's specific needs, achieving deeper optimization compared to the preset configurations. Let's look at how we can create a custom `PassManager` and apply it to a workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Creating a Custom Pass Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom pass manager, you can combine various strategies together to form a transformation. Here is an example using `Collect2qBlocks`, `ConsolidateBlocks`, and `UnitarySynthesis` to optimize the circuit. You can refer to the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_passes) to know more about their transformation.\n"
